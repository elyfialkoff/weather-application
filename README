In order to use this weather application:

create a .env file and add API_KEY with your api key from https://openweathermap.org/
  - you will need to sign up to get a key (its all free, and will only take a few minutes)

then run npm install

then run node app.js -l <cityname,country>
by default the temperature is returned in imperial, if you want metric add the -m flag

note that if the city has multiple words then you will need to surround it with single quotes
